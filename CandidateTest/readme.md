# About

This program read the console input string with an arithmetical expression and calculates the value. 
However, at the moment it is very limited in functionality, meaning that it supports only addition for integer numbers. Your task is to:

* Implement subtraction operator;
* Implement floating-point numbers support;
* Implement multiplication operator;
* Invalid expressoin validation;
